# DaVinciCodeTheTrackOfRobertLangdon

<p style='text-align: justify;'> For this project, we extract information from Dan Brown's book *The Da Vinci Code*. with different natural language processing (NLP) and text mining techniques. More specifically, we aim to extract the places visited by the characters throughout the book.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
After performing some coreference resolution with Lingmess and SpanBERT, we use BERT and RoBERTa for named entity recognition (NER), normalizing the output with soft TF-IDF and Levenshtein distance. Afterwards, we map characters to location and lastly perform some topic modeling comparing LDA and BERTopic. Finally, we end this [report](Da_Vinci_Code__The_Track_of_Robert_Langdon.pdf) by revealing the different sites visited by Robert Langdon throughout his quest.
